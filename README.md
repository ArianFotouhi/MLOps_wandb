## What is wandb?

Weights and Biases (wandb) is a platform for machine learning experiment tracking, and it provides tools to help data scientists and machine learning engineers keep track of their experiments, datasets, and other resources.

## Why to use wandb?

Experiment Tracking: Wandb allows you to log and track various aspects of your machine learning experiments, including hyperparameters, metrics, and visualizations. This makes it easier to understand how different settings impact your model's performance and helps in fine-tuning your models.

Visualization and Reporting: You can use wandb to visualize your training progress in real-time. 

Versioning: With wandb, you can save and version your datasets, code, and model checkpoints as <strong> artifacts</strong>. 

Collaboration: Wandb supports collaborative machine learning workflows. You can share experiment results, datasets, and code with team members, making it easier for multiple people to work on the same project while keeping everything organized and accessible.

Hyperparameter Optimization: Wandb integrates with popular hyperparameter optimization libraries like Optuna and Ray Tune, allowing you to efficiently search for the best hyperparameter configurations for your models.

Cloud-Based Storage: Wandb offers cloud-based storage for your experiment data, artifacts, and visualizations. This means you don't need to worry about managing storage infrastructure, and you can access your results from anywhere.
